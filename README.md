# Rules for CONTRIBUTING

- Try to create a new branch and then try to raise a pr.

- Naming convention for your own branch -
  <your name intials - update>
  For example,
  Shambashib Majumdar is the name of the student who is raising the pr,
  then his branch name will be
  < sm-update >.

- Try to update learning resources for a code. For example, our first class in yesterday's class (Friday 18th), our Compiler Design Lab class had some intial questions about identifting an identifier.
  Try uploading the solution first in C (as they are teaching it in C), and then upload the learning resources as well.
